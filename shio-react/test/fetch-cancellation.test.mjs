/**
 * SH1047 — a read nobody can cancel, and the list of the ones that still cannot.
 *
 * ## The race
 *
 * `AbortController` appeared nowhere in the console. The content browser's page fetch is rebuilt on
 * every change of folder, sort or filter and the request it replaced was left running, so a curator
 * moving quickly can be shown a **slow earlier response over a fast later one**: the rows belong to
 * a folder they already left, under a breadcrumb that says otherwise. Nothing errors. There is no
 * way to tell by looking, which is why it needs an instrument rather than a fix alone.
 *
 * ## Why the guard is here rather than in the query layer
 *
 * SH1046's `useQuery` hands its `queryFn` a signal and aborts it when the key moves, so a page on
 * the query layer is cancelled by construction. That is the good path and it is not the whole
 * console: thirty-odd screens still read inside an effect, and the ones this task migrated did not
 * move onto the query layer because their state is a cursor or an accumulating page, which is a
 * different task. A lint that only understood `useQuery` would call those screens clean the moment
 * somebody rewrote them and blind the day somebody did not.
 *
 * ## One shared reason, said once
 *
 * `UNCANCELLED` is a list and not a ceiling — a ceiling lets this task pay the debt and the next
 * one spend it. Every entry carries the same reason, written here instead of thirty-five times:
 * *its fetching effect passes no signal, and SH1047 migrated the five screens its symptom named.*
 * Inventing a distinct sentence per file would be inventing, and a reason that is not true is worse
 * than a shared one that is. What the list is for is that a **thirty-sixth** cannot arrive quietly.
