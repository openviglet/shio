**Status legend** (status itself lives in ROADMAP.md): ⏳ partial · 📋 designed · 💭 idea.

**Section order** below follows the **suggested work order** in ROADMAP.md
(H → K → I → J → L → M → N), not the block letters — §IX is Block K, §X is
Block I, and so on. Each section header names its block.

**Cross-references** use relative paths from `docs/`; linked code may have moved —
verify against `git ls-files` before acting.

## 0. Strategy — the agent-native reorientation

> Full concept, protocol design and worked example:
> [specs/SH74-agent-native-cms.md](specs/SH74-agent-native-cms.md).

### 0.1 The goals, restated

The original brief mixed two goals — *"be relevant to today's market"* (an
architecture decision: headless/API-first) and *"let JavaScript developers build
pages"* (a DX decision). Both shipped: the CDA (Block A), the SDKs and starter
(Block B), post-types as typed code (SH62).

A third goal now supersedes them in priority, without contradicting either:

3. **"Be the CMS a coding agent can drive fast."** Optimize the whole system so an
   agent — Claude Code specifically — needs fewer cycles, fewer tokens, and fewer
   human round trips to build and then *change* a site.

This is again **not** a language decision, and again not a rewrite. It is a
decision about **protocol shape, discoverability, determinism and verifiability**.

### 0.2 What Shio is today (the facts that drive the decision)

- The headless foundation is **done**: versioned CDA with scopes/env keys/caching
  (SH1–SH5), framework-agnostic + React SDKs (SH6/SH7), Next.js starter with
  SSG/ISR/on-demand revalidation (SH8/SH9), type generation (SH11), post-types as
  typed TS code with a drift guard and a console lock (SH62–SH66), webhooks,
  preview, versioning UI, scheduling, audit, search, i18n, ACL, soft-delete
  (SH12–SH16, SH51–SH55), multi-tenancy (SH22), media + transforms (SH38–SH43,
  SH73), a full exchange/portability engine (SH68–SH72).
- Every one of those is shaped for a **human operator**: entity-shaped JSON, UUID
  addressing, a GUI-first console, docs written as prose recipes.
- The primitives an agent-native protocol needs are therefore *already here* —
  declarative sources, canonical serialization, plan/apply (`push --check`), an
  exchange package format, an audit trail, soft-delete, scoped tokens. What is
  missing is the **shape**, not the machinery.

### 0.3 Why NOT rewrite the backend (binding non-goal — unchanged)

- A rewrite costs 6–18 months just to **reach parity** — zero new user value.
- It **destroys the Turing/Dumont synergy**: shared models, security, SDKs become
  an HTTP-only island that must be re-integrated.
- **The language is not the market problem.** Reference composable CMSs are Java
  (Magnolia, dotCMS) or JS; PHP (WordPress/Drupal) *is* the legacy we want to move
  past; Go is great for infra but rare for CMS with weak admin/templating ecosystem.
- **A CMS's differentiator is never the server language** — it's the content
  model, the API, the editing experience, and delivery. Under the new orientation
  it is the *protocol*: an agent cannot tell what the server is written in, only
  how many calls it costs.
- Conclusion: rewrite = **high cost, high risk, no perceived value**. Keep Java.

### 0.4 Why in-JVM JS/Groovy templating is not the answer

Groovy would solve *server-side scripting*, but the audience never asked for it.
The same now applies to **GraalJS** (the former Block D, SH17/SH18 — **dropped**):
an agent builds the front end in Next.js, where it is strongest and where the SSG/
ISR/preview story already exists (SH8/SH9). An in-JVM script engine adds sandboxing
risk, a second template language, and hot-reload complexity, and buys the agent
nothing. The answers stay: **headless + Next.js** (Block B, shipped) for delivery,
and the **agent protocol** (Block H) for authoring.

### 0.5 The north star

> **Shio is a CMS whose primary operator is a coding agent.** The agent builds and
> maintains the site; the **human curates** — approves, corrects, tweaks; the
> **CDA delivers**. Java/Spring stays the content engine, JS/TS stays the delivery
> layer, and every new decision is judged by *agent cycles and tokens*, not clicks.

The three actors and their interfaces:

| Actor | Interface | Job |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent** (Claude Code) | MCP tools + content files on disk + CLI | Build & maintain: model, structure, content, front end, verification |
| **Human** | React console, Universal Editor (SH10), preview links, PR review | Curate: approve, correct, tweak copy, decide |
| **Front end** | CDA (REST/GraphQL) + SDKs | Deliver |

Note what this does *for the human*: with the agent doing data entry and
scaffolding, the console stops being a form-filling tool and becomes a review and
visual-tweak surface. That is a better console, not a deprecated one — and it is
why the Universal Editor and Media Library get *more* important, not less.

### 0.6 The ten design laws

Binding. A feature that violates one is wrong even if it is requested. Each new
task in Blocks H–N traces to at least one.

| # | Law | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Agent-first design order** | Every capability lands MCP → files/CLI → REST → console. A console-only feature is incomplete. |
| **P2** | **One call replaces a session** | Discovery is a product feature (manifest + context pack), not a docs problem. |
| **P3** | **Tokens are a measured budget** | Response budgets + a CI benchmark; a token regression is a build failure. |
| **P4** | **Files beat APIs for authoring** | Project content to disk; the agent's cheapest tools are `Edit`/`Write`/`Grep`. |
| **P5** | **Determinism over cleverness** | Stable order, path addressing, idempotent writes, byte-identical serialization. |
| **P6** | **Errors are instructions** | Every 4xx carries `fix`/`allowed`/`didYouMean`/`example`. |
| **P7** | **Never surprise the human** | Draft-default, dry-run, explicit publish, confirm tokens, attribution, review queue. |
| **P8** | **Skipping steps needs appliable units** | Blueprints, not prose recipes. |
| **P9** | **Close the perception loop** | Cheap textual proof (lint, routes, render digest) instead of a human round trip. |
| **P10** | **Compose, don't fork** | MCP is a shape over the CDA + console services, never a third contract. |

### 0.7 What Shio deliberately is *not*

**Shio hosts no model.** No bundled LLM, no prompt runner, no provider API keys in
the CMS, no "generate this page for me" button. Shio is the substrate an external
agent drives. The reasoning:

- The defensible asset is **protocol quality** — discoverability, determinism,
  verifiability, token economy. Inference is a commodity that someone else
  operates better.
- Embedding inference imports another vendor's rate limits, cost model, safety
  posture and outage surface into the content engine.
- The agent already *is* the intelligence, and it is on the other side of the tool
  call with far more context than the CMS could ever pass it.

Corollary: "agent-native" is measured in tool calls and tokens, never in how much
AI the product contains.

# Part 1 — the reorientation (active design)

## IX. Perception & verification loop (Block K) — ✅ shipped whole

The agent cannot see. Two of the three human round trips in a typical build existed only
for that reason, which made this the cheapest large win after Block H — a human cycle is
the most expensive unit in the system by orders of magnitude.

✅ **Shipped whole**: SH99–SH104, SH141–SH144, SH154, SH169, and the follow-ups closing
the block produced (SH609–SH642). The implementation reports live in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block K; the design subsections are gone rather than left
behind as history `git log` already holds.

**What the block established, and what later work should not relitigate:** `ok` is false
only for an *error*, because a gate that fails on what the CMS cannot prove is a gate
people bypass — and every mechanism added afterwards (SH141's delivery proof, SH142's
accepted findings, SH114-declared routes) turns a warning into a fact or an explicit
decision rather than tightening the gate. Everything the agent reads is cheap and
textual; SH102's PNG is scoped for a human. **SH187** revisits that for the other reader
→ [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block P.

**The follow-ups taught a second lesson, about the block's own instruments.** Four of
eleven were defects *in* a guard, not in the product: a lint that read prose as code, a
debt reader that could not tell a mention from an assertion, a gate whose fallback was
null in the deployment it demands, and a "flake" that was a scoping bug. A perception
loop that cannot perceive itself is the failure this block should expect next.

## X. Content as files (Block I)

> The largest cycle reducer, and the least obvious. Authoring over HTTP is the
> wrong medium for an agent; a git-diffable text tree is the right one — the agent
> is measurably better and cheaper with `Edit`/`Write`/`Grep` than with
> read-modify-write over an API.

> ✅ **SH86, SH87, SH88, SH89 and SH90 shipped** → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block I.
> What follows is the design rationale for what the projection **still owes**.

## XI. Blueprints + Claude Code plugin (Block J)

*"Skip steps with things that are already done"* only works if the ready-made thing is
**appliable**, not readable. A prose recipe an agent must read and reimplement saves
nothing — it just moves the work. **Absorbs the old SH23 marketplace epic** (SH27–SH31).

✅ **Block J is shipped** → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block J. The format, the verb,
the first-party set, the section vocabulary, the Claude Code plugin, the five mismatches
that shipping the two halves exposed, and the whole marketplace — catalogue, install,
published seed, CLI, MCP tool and console — are all there, and SH682 closed the block by
giving the two writes the role the blueprint reload already had.

## XII. Agent safety & human-in-the-loop (Block L)

> An agent-driven CMS is only adoptable if a human can bound it and undo it.
> **Invariant: the agent path is never a privilege escalation** — tenant isolation
> (SH22), content ACL (SH54) and token scopes apply identically on every agent
> surface. An agent-native CMS that quietly runs as root is not adoptable.
>
> SH106–SH109, SH200 and SH201 have shipped; their design notes are gone with them (see
> CHANGELOG.md Block L). What remains here is the one task still blocked, plus the follow-ups
> SH200/SH201 turned up.
>
> **The invariant grew a second edge while they landed.** SH106–SH109 were all argued as
> tightenings, and SH201 is the same rule read from the other end: after Block L the agent path
> was in places *stricter than the console*, and where that happens the console is the hole. The
> form to carry forward is symmetrical — **the two surfaces enforce the same ACL, and whichever
> is stricter is the correct one.** SH222–SH226 are the places that edge points at next.

## XIII. Token economy, measured (Block M) — what the measurement opened

> ✅ **Block M shipped in full**, including the six follow-ups the measurement itself opened
> → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block M. The design rationale for shipped work lives there
> and in the code; `git log` is the history. What follows is only the unshipped remainder —
> and, again, all of it exists because the block did what it was built to do: produce
> numbers, and then disagree with an assumption.
>
> The current reading is **tokens 2.8×–10.5×, tool calls 2.3×–3.8×**. SH157 was the first
> change in three blocks to move a ratio by improving the *agent* path rather than by the
> baseline getting leaner, and what it left behind is mostly the shape of that argument
> getting harder: the calls that remain are real work.

## XIV. Realignment of what already shipped (Block N) — what building it opened

> The reorientation was mostly additive, but it did invalidate some existing choices.
> Block N spent them → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block N, and so are the tasks that
> building it opened (SH163–SH167, SH233, SH234), the ones that finishing it turned up
> (SH235–SH237, SH239, SH240, SH668), and the last three, which were all about an
> instrument being wrong rather than a feature (SH729, SH731, SH737). Nothing is left
> open here. Concept spec §10 has the original table.

## XV. The visible site (Block P)

> An agent can build a site's model, folders and pages over the agent surface, and nobody
> can look at the result. This section is the gap between *correct content* and *a page a
> person sees* — the product's differentiator, and the one part of the loop with no path
> through it.

### XV.0 What the original engine actually was (the `FSP` analysis)

Before designing a renderer it is worth knowing precisely what was removed, because the
reputation of the old engine ("Nashorn, therefore unsafe, therefore never again") turns out to
describe its *host* and not its *design*. `origin/FSP` is not a divergent branch — it is an
ancestor of `HEAD`, last touched **2019-09-09** — so this is Shio's own history, readable with
`git show origin/FSP:<path>`.

The pipeline:

```
URL → ShSitesContextURL                        parse object id + `format`
    → site.postTypeLayout                      {PostType: [{format, layout, mimeType, cacheTTL}]}
    → PT-PAGE-LAYOUT post                      attrs: HTML, JAVASCRIPT, THEME
    → Nashorn eval(JAVASCRIPT)                 bindings: shContent, html, request
         ├── shObject.js                        a 174-line façade over 7 Java components
         └── handlebars.min.js                  ← the actual template language
    → ShCachePage / ShCachePageLayout           keyed page cache, honouring cacheTTL
```

Four things follow, and they reverse the conclusion I would otherwise have reached.

### XV.0.1 The template language was Handlebars, not JavaScript

`ShCacheJavascript.shObjectJSFactory()`
concatenates `classpath:/js/server-side/shObject.js` and `handlebars.min.js` and evaluates them
once per thread. Authors wrote Handlebars — logic-less, declarative, no code execution. Nashorn
was the *host* that ran Handlebars and bridged to Java; it was never the authoring surface.

**The capability set was already meant to be closed.** `shObject.js` exposes seven functions and
nothing else — `formComponent`, `searchComponent`, `navigation`, `navigationFolder`, `query`,
`queryByPostType`, `getRelation` — each a one-line wrapper over a Spring bean bound in
`ShNashornEngineConfiguration` (`shNavigationComponent`, `shQueryComponent`, `shSearchComponent`,
`shFormComponent`, `shGetRelationComponent`, plus three `*Utils`). That is an allow-list
expressed as a convention.

### XV.0.2 The liability was the host, and it was real

`ShNashornEngineConfiguration` calls
`getScriptEngine(String[])` — Nashorn's `getScriptEngine(ClassFilter)` overload exists precisely
to bound what a script may reach, and it is not used. So a layout's JavaScript had `Java.type()`
over the entire classpath: `Runtime.exec`, file I/O, the `DataSource`. The raw
`HttpServletRequest` was bound into script scope as `request`, and `shObject.js` uses it
directly. Layouts are *content*, so this made a content author a JVM operator. §0.4's objection
is correct and this is the concrete form of it — but it indicts `eval`, not Handlebars and not
the layout model.

**Two smaller design notes worth keeping.** `regionError` reports a script failure with file,
line, column, a five-line window and a caret under the offending character — better authoring
feedback than most template engines ship, and exactly the shape law P6 asks for. And the
`ThreadLocal<Map<String, ScriptContext>>` that caches script contexts per thread reuses bindings
across requests, which is a state-leak between visitors; a template evaluator with no mutable
global scope does not have that problem to solve.

### XV.0.3 What the model handled that a fixed section vocabulary does not

This is the question that
matters for SH183, and the answer is unambiguous. Navigation, queries and listings, search
results and forms are all *dynamic* — none is expressible as a static section post, and all four
were first-class in the old engine. A closed vocabulary of eight section types cannot render a
menu, a paginated article list, a search results page or a contact form. It also had two axes
this repository has no equivalent for: **format** (the same post rendered as `default`, or as
another format with its own layout, mime type and TTL — the mechanism behind alternate
representations) and **theme** (`PT-THEME`, resolved per layout).

**The lineage.** The model is OpenText WEM / Vignette V7's — page → template → component, with
presentation held as managed content rather than as files in a build. That is why the levels line
up the way they do, and it is worth knowing when weighing the design: this is a shape with
twenty years of enterprise use behind it, not an invention.

### XV.0.4 The objection: V7 rendered with a script engine too

It did, and that precedent is real — the objection deserves an answer rather than a
restatement of the non-goal. Two things changed, and neither is about capability.

*The threat model.* In V7's era a template author was a trusted employee, templates
shipped through a controlled release process, and the server sat on a corporate network.
In Shio a layout is content; content is written by an **agent**, and packages are meant
to arrive from a registry whose trust story is still an open question (SH96 exists
precisely because "where may a package come from" is unanswered). Add the multi-tenant
direction (SH22, SH45–SH47) and "content can execute arbitrary JVM code" stops being a
convenience and becomes a tenant escape. The same design is safe under one set of
assumptions and not under the other.

*The runtime.* Nashorn was deprecated in JDK 11 and **removed from the JDK in 15**. What
is left is the standalone `org.openjdk.nashorn` artifact — the one still sitting unused
in `shio-app/pom.xml`, pinned at 15.7, on a project running Java 21. Building the
product's differentiator on it would mean betting the render path on a library that
exists to ease migration *away* from itself.

So the conclusion is not "V7 was wrong". It is that the part of V7 worth keeping is the
**model** — page → template → component, presentation as managed content — and the part
that has to be replaced is the host that ran it.

### XV.0.5 What a real template looked like: regions are slotted by an HTML attribute

`openviglet/bootstrap-site` is not a project — it is an `export.json`, an SH68 exchange
package, and its ten posts are `PT-FOLDER-INDEX` ×1, `PT-ARTICLE` ×3, `PT-PAGE-LAYOUT`
×2, `PT-REGION` ×2, `PT-THEME` ×1, `PT-FILE` ×1. The presentation *is* content, and it
travels the same way content does. Four things in it settle the design:

**1. Regions are slotted by an HTML attribute.** A layout's `HTML` field is a whole
document with named holes:

```html
<body>
  <div sh-region="BOOTSTRAP_NAV_REGION"> </div>
  <div sh-region="BOOTSTRAP_CONTENT_LIST_REGION" style="margin:20px"></div>
```

`sh-region` is the composition mechanism, and it is also — already, in 2018 — exactly
the annotation contract the Universal Editor needs, which SH185 later wrote down as a
protocol → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block P. A rendered page that keeps these
attributes tells the editor what each part of the DOM is and which post to save it to.

### XV.0.6 The layout's JavaScript is ceremony, not capability

Both layouts carry the same four
lines:

```js
load('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/handlebars.js/4.0.11/handlebars.min.js');
var template = Handlebars.compile(html);
var html = template(shContent);
html;
```

Compile the HTML as a Handlebars template against the data, return it. That is what
Handlebars.java does natively with no script at all. (The article layout adds one small data
remap — `{title, description, text, theme}` picked out of `shContent` — which is a projection,
not logic.) Note also `load('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/...')`: the engine fetched its
template library **from a CDN at render time**, so the render path depended on remote code
being both reachable and unmodified.

### XV.0.7 A region's JavaScript is a view-model builder, and every part of it is a helper

The
navigation region registers a helper, calls a component, and reshapes the result:

```js
Handlebars.registerHelper('file_url', ...);              // → a value helper
var navigation = shObject.navigation(siteName, true);    // → a block helper
forEach.call(navigation, function (shFolder) { ... });   // → the helper yields this
```

and the content-list region is the same shape: `shObject.query(folderId, "PT-ARTICLE")`, then a
loop mapping `TITLE`/`DESCRIPTION`/`TEXT` and building links with
`shObject.generateObjectLink`. Between 767 and 1098 characters of hand-written JavaScript per
region, to produce what a domain-aware block helper produces in one line:

```hbs
{{#query folder=this postType="PT-ARTICLE"}}
  <div class="card"><h5>{{title}}</h5><a href="{{link}}">Read More</a></div>
{{/query}}
```

So migrating to registered helpers is not a loss of expressiveness — it is the removal of
boilerplate that exists only because the loop had nowhere else to live. The templates themselves
(`{{#each}}`, `{{#if}}`, `{{{text}}}`, custom helpers) are ordinary Handlebars and port as-is.

### XV.0.8 A theme carries site-wide assets

`PT-THEME` has `CSS` and `JAVASCRIPT` fields — both
`null` in this sample, so the intent is clearer than the usage: one place for the stylesheet and
script a whole site shares, referenced by each layout's `THEME` field.

So the honest conclusion is that the old engine's *architecture* was better than what replaced
it for the specific job of "make something a human can see" — and the only part that has to go
is one line, `scriptEngine.eval(javascript, sc)`, plus the boilerplate that existed to feed it.

## XVI. The human half (Block O) — what reading the console next found

Block O shipped, and its lesson was that **console defects answer `200`**: seven of them, none
visible to a Java test, a CLI test or the MCP golden. The two below were found the same way but
from a different angle — not by driving the console, but by fixing the *agent's* move verbs
(SH134/SH137/SH139) and having to read the console's implementation of the same operation each
time. The pattern is consistent enough to state as an expectation: **when a verb exists on both
surfaces, the console's copy is where the careless version lives**, because nothing on it is
asserted at the level the agent surface is.

> ✅ **SH202 and SH203 shipped** → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block O. Their two durable
> rules: a copy corrects each of its names **in the scope that name is unique in** (title per
> folder, URL per site — sharing one counter renames a page for a collision the curator cannot
> see), and **the client prevents what it can see, the server refuses what it must**. The five
> sections below are what finishing them found. A sixth, **SH246** — the Java suite red by one
> since SH144 made the incident store durable — has since shipped too; its answer was the
> SH164/SH239 precedent, that a test asserting something about the whole instance has to boot
> its own database.

# Part 2 — pre-existing sections

## I. Headless foundation — the CDA

> ✅ **Fully shipped (SH1–SH5)** → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block A; per-task
> design records in `docs/specs/SH1`–`SH5`. Under the new orientation the CDA is
> the **read substrate every agent tool composes over** (P10) — unchanged, and more
> load-bearing than before. The SH1 forward-compat constraints (state is a
> service-level param, not a URL segment; `siteId` is a first-class query param)
> still bind, and now also bind the agent surface.

## II. JavaScript-for-pages DX

> ✅ **Fully shipped (SH6–SH11, and the SH62 epic SH63–SH66)** →
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block B; specs `SH11-type-generation.md`,
> `SH62-post-types-dsl.md`. **Why it still matters:** post-types-as-code is the
> template the whole agent-native protocol follows — declarative source → canonical
> serialization → plan → apply → drift guard → explicit GUI/code boundary. Blocks H
> and I are that same pattern applied to content and to the protocol itself.
> (Historic subsection anchors `§II.1`–`§II.7`, cited by `docs/specs/*` and no longer
> headings here, map to SH6, SH7, SH8, SH9, SH10, SH11, SH62.)

## III. Composable platform primitives

> ✅ **Fully shipped (SH12–SH16, SH26, SH51–SH55)** → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
> Block C. The agent surface leans directly on four of them: the **audit trail**
> (SH51 → the change feed and attribution), **soft-delete** (SH55 → revert), the
> **draft/published diff** (SH14 → review), and **search**
> (SH52 → `shio_find`). Open follow-up: folder soft-delete (subtree-hide semantics).
> (Historic anchors `§III.1`–`§III.10`, cited by `docs/specs/*` and no longer headings
> here, map to SH12–SH16, SH51–SH55.)

## IV. Server-side JS rendering — dropped

> ⛔ **Dropped as a non-goal.** The former Block D (SH17 GraalJS spike, SH18 `.js`

## XVII Replication (Block Q) — a site that already exists becomes one an agent can author

The question this block answers is one a customer asks in one sentence: *take the site
we have and make it a Shio site the agent maintains.* Nothing in Blocks A–P is wrong for
it, and none of it is aimed at it — every capability assumes the site is being
**built**, from a blueprint or from nothing. A replication inverts the direction: the
target already exists, somebody else's markup is the specification, and "done" is not
"it renders" but "it renders the same".

That inversion splits into three phases, and each has a different owner. **Capture** is
the CLI's, because the instance fetches no URL (SH268) and runs no browser (a standing
non-goal). **Convert** is the file tree's, because a proposal a human corrects before it
is applied is a diff, not an API call (P4, P7). **Prove** is the perception loop's, and
it is the phase Block P left honest about its limits — the appearance digest covers the
failure an *agent* creates and not the one a human sees (SH265), which is precisely the
failure a replica has.

Two gaps in the middle are not about replication at all: they are ordinary site features
nobody has needed yet because no first-party blueprint has a menu, a second page of a
listing, or six languages. They surface here because a real site has all three.

## XIX The public site (Block S)

Turing ships turing.viglet.org and Shio ships a README. The product with the sharpest
positioning statement in the portfolio - a CMS whose primary operator is a coding agent
- has no page that says so, and the ten laws, the eleven MCP tools, the content-as-files
projection and site replication are legible only to somebody who already cloned the
repository.

This block builds that page in the shape `apps/site` already proved in Turing: Vite,
React 19, Tailwind v4 and shadcn/ui, prerendered to static HTML per route, served at the
root of a domain, with no backend of its own. What it does not copy is the argument.
Turing's centrepiece is a live search box, because a visitor can type a query and judge
the answer. Shio's is a Claude Code session, because what is being sold is not a feature
a human operates - it is how cheaply an agent operates the product. Every section on the
landing page therefore answers one of the ten laws with something a visitor can check: a
token count, a teaching 4xx, a file tree, a draft that did not publish itself.

The site is also written for the reader it is about. An agent evaluating a CMS reads the
page it was handed, and a Claude Code-first product that answers only in HTML is making
its own argument badly.

## XX End-user documentation, round two (Block T)

Block R measured this and could not fix it. It took the coverage matrix from **33 wrong
of 40** to **6**, and every one of the six was a cluster **no Block R task ever named**
— not leftovers that ran out of time, never in scope. That is the finding the matrix
existed to produce, and it is why these were a block rather than a snagging list.

Four of the six were curator-facing, which inverts who actually needs a page: an agent
reads a manifest, a person reads a page or gives up. P7 — *never surprise the human* —
is the law the gap sat on. The seventh entry was the one a scan could not see: the image
epic's operator half scored 🧩 rather than 🔴, and a partially-covered row does not read
as an orphan.

**Two tasks are worth keeping for their shape.** SH623 and SH628 were ⚠️ — a page
describing a shape the product left — and that is a *rewrite*, because a new section
under stale prose makes the page contradict itself. SH628 landed the instrument first
(SH322): a version in prose is a claim nothing derives, so `docs-stack.conformance.mjs`
reads Java, Spring Boot, Node and pnpm out of this repository's build files and fails
any page — `README.md` included — that states another. It found three defects on its
first run, and a fourth in SH499's own reader.

## XXI Documentation the matrix still names (Block U)

Block T closed every row its own tasks named and left this file's audit still holding
two entries — one because the summary that scans it could not see the row, and one
because that summary is typed rather than derived. They are the same defect at two
altitudes, which is why they are one block rather than a footnote on the last one.

The block's rule is SH338's: the count is fixed before the page is written. A page added
under a summary that cannot count it is a page the next scan will not know exists.

## XXII Realignment of what already shipped

Block N's family. It holds the cases where a capability shipped complete against its own
brief and incomplete against a law — most often P1, where the console got an interface
and nothing else did. These are not defects in the feature; the feature works. They are
defects in its *reach*, and they are filed separately because the fix is almost never in
the code the original task wrote.

Its recent entries widened that beyond features, and mostly concern instruments failing
to reach: one blind to half the repository (SH738), a *process document* routing a
reader past an instrument that exists (SH739), a rule stopping at a language boundary
(SH740), a ledger taking a shape without the guard that makes it safe (SH741), and a
population found by naming convention rather than by structure (SH742). Nothing is left
open here → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) Block N.

## XXIII The vocabulary proved live (integration tests against a running instance)

Shio's whole product claim is a vocabulary an external agent drives: thirteen MCP tools
over `POST /mcp` and `shio mcp`, thirty-three CLI commands, and the `/api/v2/agent/**`
ops underneath both. Almost all of it is proved by MockMvc in `shio-app` and by module
imports in `cli/test/` — two tiers that, by construction, cannot be wrong about the
thing an agent actually meets: the tool name it must guess right, the input schema it
must spell, the framing, the response budget, and the shape of the refusal it has to
read to recover. `cli/conformance/` is the tier with an instance, and it calls two
tools.

This block closes that gap deliberately and in order. First the instrument that counts
what has never been spoken live, because six suites with no denominator prove nothing
about coverage. Then the read half, the write half, the teaching errors, the CLI surface
and the live budgets. Then the part a per-verb suite structurally cannot reach: the
chaotic run — verbs interleaved, sequenced wrongly on purpose, permuted under a recorded
seed — because an agent does not call the vocabulary in the order a test author
imagined, and every ordering bug in the product to date has been found by somebody doing
it out of order.

Non-goals bind here as everywhere: the instance runs no browser, and none of this
becomes a third contract.

## XXIV The vocabulary proved live (Block V)

Where the rationale for Block V lives: what a running instance has been asked, and what
it has not. The tier exists because a MockMvc proof and a wire answer can disagree —
over a schema the client had to guess, a refusal slug it has to branch on, or a cache
nothing in a Spring test can have. SH707's matrix is what keeps that honest by naming,
rather than counting, the verbs no live suite has ever called.

## XXV Realignment of what already shipped (Block N)

Where the rationale for Block N lives. The block is a standing category rather than a
project: it receives findings about work that already shipped, so it empties and reopens
rather than finishing, and each reopening is one finding whose repair is not itself a
feature.

## XXVI What the replication round left behind (Block W)

Block Q closed with SH774 after a round that changed what a replica *is* to a curator:
kept markup became content they can move rather than a field they cannot reach.

What it left behind is of three kinds, and none of them is a feature.

**A sweep.** A closed block owes its reader-facing surfaces one pass, and this one
changed the thing those pages describe.

**Corpus gaps the round exposed by needing them.** Every question asked of the section
vocabulary's own render cost went unanswered because the benchmark's pages compose no
sections — so the shape the product is *about* is the one shape nothing measures.

**Capability limits found by hitting them.** A template cannot ask an aggregate question
about a relation, which decided SH772's design rather than being noticed in the
abstract.

The block exists because these were found *while* doing the work and would otherwise
evaporate with the commit that revealed them — the cheapest findings the project ever
gets, and the ones with no reporter but the person who tripped over them.

### XXVI.4 The one red nobody could read (SH778)

Seen once, on 2026-08-17, running `node --test "test/*.test.mjs"`:

    ✖ test\fixture-traits.test.mjs (859.7731ms)
      'test failed'

Run alone, the same file passes nine of nine in 162 ms. The next full run was green too.
So there is one sighting, no named assertion, and a suite that has been green either
side of it.

This is the shape SH354 spent a task on from the other end — a red that leaves no record
of *which* test failed — and it is worth a task rather than a shrug for the reason that
one names: it has happened before, *"one run in six, never reproduced, undiagnosable"*,
and a flake nobody writes down is re-discovered from scratch every time somebody sees
it.

The file serves a captured fixture over a socket (`SH528`), which is the ingredient a
flake usually has: a port, a server that must be up before the first request, and a
teardown that must not outlive the run. SH698 fixed a conformance teardown of exactly
that kind — naming the server, the deadline and the open sockets instead of hanging —
and this file has no equivalent.

What is owed first is not a fix but evidence: a failure here has to say which assertion,
on which trait, with the port and the server's state. Then the fix, if it is still
reproducible. Filed now because the sighting is the perishable part.

### XXVI.6 The cure that waits on a sighting (SH780)

SH778 shipped the evidence half and stopped there on purpose. What it established, by
measurement rather than by guessing, is what the failure is **not**: not an assertion
(1499 pass, 1 fail, and the one failure is the file with both its tests green), not an
unhandled rejection or exception (SH698's handlers print first and printed nothing), and
not the teardown deadline (`closeFixture` rejects naming the server and its open
sockets; that message is absent and the test owning the `t.after` reported green).

What is left is the file's own **process exit**. `node --test` marks a file failed when
its process exits non-zero whatever its tests said, and `--test-force-exit` is in the
command the gate runs — a forced exit is exactly where a code appears with no other
trace. SH778's third instrument prints that code and the active handles.

It has not fired. Twelve runs after it landed — six ordinary, six at
`--test-concurrency=32` — all green, which matches SH698's eighteen. Two sightings in
roughly fifteen full runs is the observed rate, and it appears under the whole suite
rather than alone.

So this task owns the cure and cannot start until the instrument speaks. It stays open
because the `red-suites.json` entry has to name a task that removes it, and an entry
whose owner has shipped is the state SH594 fails on. Delete that entry in the same
commit as the fix.

### XXVI.9 The lock that reads as a build failure (SH783)

Hit four times in one session, always the same way:

    Failed to clean project: Failed to delete
    D:\...\shio-app\target\viglet-shio.jar

Every time the cause was a `java -jar` instance started for a conformance run and still
holding the file. Nothing in the output says so. What it looks like is a broken build,
and the reflex it teaches is to re-run — which works, because by then the instance has
usually been stopped for an unrelated reason, so the lesson never lands.

It is already written down, in the two memories a session may or may not have loaded,
and that is exactly the shape this project keeps converting into an instrument: a fact
carried in somebody's head, costing a wasted run each time it is not.

Decidable from inside the repository. On Windows the holder is findable, but the cheaper
and more portable check is the question the developer actually needs answered: **is
anything listening on the ports this project's instances use** (2710 for the dev
instance, 2711 for the clean one the conformance sequence starts). A preflight that
fails with *"an instance is running on 2711 and is holding target/viglet-shio.jar — stop
it before clean"* turns a re-run into a sentence.

Worth pairing with the other half of the same trap, which cost a false red earlier in
the same session: `clean` failing means the *build did not run*, so a green summary
above it describes the previous tree.

### XXVI.10 The pause this project cannot spell (SH784)

Found by trying it:

    roadkeep: SH778 cannot be set aside: no deferred store is declared — add
    `deferred = "<path>"` under [files]

SH778 is waiting for an intermittent failure to reappear so its instrument can name it,
and SH780 is the cure that waits on SH778. Neither can start. With no deferred store the
only two spellings are **⏳ in flight**, which `pick` offers on every iteration and a
reader has to keep declining, and **retire**, which is terminal: the id cannot come
back, the resolver reads a dep on it as never, and the rationale is deleted.

So the backlog cannot say the true thing, which is *real, owned, and not startable yet*.
The cost is small and constant: every pick offers work nobody can do, and the reason has
to be re-derived each time from the section rather than read off the line.

Adopting the store is one key in `roadkeep.toml` and a file with the block headings.
What needs care is the second half, and SH781 just built the precedent: an exception in
`red-suites.json` requires its task to be **on the roadmap**, and a deferred line is not
— so deferring a task would delete the reason for the entry that tracks its red, which
is the same collision one file over. Both readers now ask the roadmap rather than the
changelog; a deferred store means teaching them a third state rather than two.
